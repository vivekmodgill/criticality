# criticality

Criticality in the context of neuroscience and complex systems refers to a state in which the system is poised at a "critical point" between order and disorder. This concept is borrowed from physics, specifically from the study of phase transitions (e.g., water turning into ice or vapour). In a critical state, systems exhibit specific features like scale invariance, power-law distributions, and maximized dynamic range, which make them highly responsive and flexible.

In brain activity, criticality is believed to allow the brain to optimize its computational capabilities by balancing two extremes: 
1. Order (subcritical state): The brain is too ordered, meaning that signals propagate in a rigid, predictable manner. This state lacks flexibility and can lead to reduced information processing capacity.
2. Disorder (supercritical state): The brain is too chaotic, meaning that signals are overly erratic and noisy, leading to a lack of stable processing or memory retention.

DFA Exponents (α) and Criticality Interpretation
The DFA exponent (α), derived through Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), is used to quantify the degree of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in a time series. This measure is often applied to EEG, fMRI, and simulated data to assess criticality.

Here’s what different DFA exponents generally represent:

1. α ≈ 0.5: This is characteristic of uncorrelated white noise, indicating a lack of temporal correlations. Such systems exhibit random, non-critical behaviour, implying the system is in a highly disordered or supercritical state.

2. 0.5 < α < 1: This range represents long-range temporal correlations. These systems show memory and correlation over time. In the brain, DFA exponents closer to 1 (but below it) are often associated with a subcritical state, where the brain is more structured but not at the critical threshold.

3. α ≈ 1: This is considered the hallmark of criticality. Systems at criticality balance between order and disorder, with power-law scaling and maximized information transmission. The brain may operate in this range during resting states, allowing for flexible responses to external inputs while maintaining stability.

4. α > 1: When the DFA exponent exceeds 1, the system enters a supercritical state, which is overly ordered or deterministic. Signals propagate in a highly correlated manner, reducing the brain's capacity for flexible information processing. This may occur in highly synchronized neuronal states, like seizures, or when the system is "too structured."

Brain Criticality in Empirical Recordings

Resting-state EEG or fMRI data from healthy individuals tend to show DFA exponents close to α ≈ 1, indicating critical dynamics.
Pathological states, such as epilepsy, can show deviations from criticality, often with exponents α > 1, suggesting overly synchronised, supercritical behaviour.
Subcritical states (α closer to 0.5) can be associated with noisy, uncoordinated brain dynamics.

Importance of Criticality in Brain Function
1. Efficient Information Processing: At criticality, the brain can optimally transmit and process information, as signals can propagate over long distances without being overly dampened or amplified.
2. Dynamic Range: The critical state maximises the brain’s sensitivity to a wide range of stimuli, allowing for flexible responses to external changes.
3. Memory and Learning: Long-range temporal correlations associated with criticality help the brain retain memory over time and adapt to new information.

In summary:
- α ≈ 1: Critical state—ideal for flexible, efficient brain functioning.
- α > 1: Supercritical—indicates excessive order or synchronization (e.g., seizure-like states).
- α < 1: Subcritical—indicates excessive noise or disorder, limiting effective communication.
